# Gospeed Docker Documentation
=====================================================

## Overview

This is the configuration file for a Docker Compose setup that deploys two services: `gospeed` and `watchtower`. The `gospeed` service uses the `liwei2633/gopeed` image version 1.6.0, mapping ports from container to host (9999), and volumes for data persistence.

## In-Depth Explanation

### Gospeed Service Configuration

*   `image`: Specifies the Docker image to use for the service. In this case, it's `liwei2633/gopeed:1.6.0`.
*   `container_name`: Sets a name for the container.
*   `ports`: Maps ports between the host and the container. Here, port 9999 on the host is mapped to port 9999 inside the container.
*   `volumes`: Mounts volumes from the host into the container, enabling persistent storage. The volumes are specified as `- /home/satyajit/Downloads/gospeed:/app/Downloads` and `- ./storage:/app/storage`.
*   `restart`: Configures the restart policy for the service. In this case, it's set to "unless-stopped," which means the container will be restarted if it exits or crashes.

### Watchtower Service Configuration

*   `image`: Specifies the Docker image to use for the service. In this case, it's `containrrr/watchtower:1.7.1`.
*   `container_name`: Sets a name for the container.
*   `volumes`: Mounts a volume from the host into the container to enable access to the Docker socket.
*   `command`: Specifies the command to run inside the container. Here, it's set to "--cleanup," which implies cleaning up unused images and containers managed by Watchtower.
*   `restart`: Configures the restart policy for the service. In this case, it's set to "unless-stopped," meaning the container will be restarted if it exits or crashes.

## Usage Examples

To use this Docker Compose configuration:

1.  Place the `docker-compose.yml` file in a directory.
2.  Install Docker and Docker Compose on your system if you haven't already.
3.  Navigate to the directory containing your `docker-compose.yml` file.
4.  Run `docker-compose up -d` to start both services as detached background processes.

## Best Practices and Optimization

When using this configuration:

*   Be cautious of security risks associated with exposing port 9999 on your host machine.
*   Consider adding more robust volume configurations or encryption options if you handle sensitive data.
*   Regularly review the `liwei2633/gopeed` and `containrrr/watchtower` images for security updates, ensuring they don't pose a risk to your system.

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

Troubleshooting steps:

1.  Ensure both Docker and Compose are installed on your host.
2.  Review the container names (`gospeed` and `watchtower`) to ensure they're unique across your environment.
3.  Be cautious of conflicts between this setup and other Docker or Compose configurations.

## Sensitive Data Masking

Sensitive information, such as database credentials, is not explicitly listed in the code due to security considerations. However, you should mask any sensitive data that's hardcoded into the images (e.g., database passwords) with placeholders like `[MASKED]`.

This documentation provides an overview of a simple Docker Compose setup for two services. It highlights important configuration settings and offers practical advice on usage and potential pitfalls.
